## We want pandas to read our CSV file from that S3 bucket so we use a pandas function called read_csv  to pull the data into a dataframe we'll call my_fruit_list. 
# Remember the S3 Bucket from DWW? 
# We're going to use a CSV file from that bucket in our app. 
# The file is here: https://uni-lab-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dabw/fruit_macros.txt

# Let's Create Some User Interaction
# We'll add a user interactive widget called a Multi-select that will allow users to pick the fruits they want in their smoothies.

# Let's put a pick list here so they can pick the fruit they want to include 

# The picker works, but the numbers don't make any sense! We want the customer to be able to choose the fruits by name!!
#  Choose the Fruit Name Column as the Index

my_fruit_list = my_fruit_list.set_index('Fruit')
#streamlit.multiselect("Pick some fruits:", list(my_fruit_list.index))

#Lets Choose a Few Fruits to Set a Good Example
#We want to filter the table data based on the fruits a customer will choose, so we'll pre-populate the list to set an example for the customer. 

#streamlit.multiselect("Pick some fruits:", list(my_fruit_list.index),['Avocado','Strawberries'])
# Display the table on the page.
#streamlit.dataframe(my_fruit_list)

#Now we just have to make the table below the picker a bit smarter so it's doesn't load all the fruits, just the ones shown in the pick list. 

fruits_selected = streamlit.multiselect("Pick some fruits:", list(my_fruit_list.index),['Avocado','Strawberries'])
